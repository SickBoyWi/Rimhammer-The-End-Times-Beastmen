There's three mortars with a handful of shots each. Avoid the open areas around the castle towers so the warmachine emplacements cannot hit you. Bring some cygors so you can take out the main castle walls while staying in cover. The emplaced warmachines have the gates covered against melee forces.\n\nIf you fail, you can always try again with a bigger herd.\n\nTo grow your herd to a proper size, try smashing bases of the Cloven Ones. When you do so, some of the remaining beasts will join your clearly more powerful herd.</RH_TET_Beastmen_FinalDestructionHelp>

	<RH_TET_Beastmen_DestroyedOrderDesc>The enemy at the {0} has been destroyed.\n\nIt was a gloriously brutal day of beastial victory. Burn the town to the ground, and rip the castle apart block by block. Consume your fallen foes and rejoice in the power of the dark gods.</RH_TET_Beastmen_DestroyedOrderDesc>
	<RH_TET_FinalDestructionVictory>Victory has been claimed for the dark gods! Well done! You've smashed the forces of good, and ensured The End Times would truly come to pass.\n\nBlood flowed through the streets of the pathetic human town, and the castle was painted red with the blood of its former occupants. The dark powers swell with power at the destruction that you have wrought.\n\nThis mod was developed by Johnny Hastings (@SickBoyWI). Special thanks to @Dino's Bar and Grill for the fantastic artwork he generously donated his time and skills for that went into this mod; it made up for my lack of graphics skills, and made the Rimhammer - The End Times mod series that much more great.\n\nThank you for playing.\n\nYou're free to call it a win for now, or keep playing and see what else happens in the world. If that's the case, hit the escape key to return to the game.\n\nPlease look me up on Patreon, or Ko-Fi and donate what you feel this was worth! This beastman end game quest took me several weeks to design, create images for, and code up. I'm one guy who spends a whole lot of time on these mods. If you enjoyed it, then please show your love! I'll be encouraged to finish the other factions/races that much quicker if everyone contributes.</RH_TET_FinalDestructionVictory>

	<RH_TET_Beastmen_FailedFinalDestructionDesc>Your attempt to bring destruction upon the forces of Order has failed.
